1. Use init_heap() to activate the external runtime in C.
2. Use caml_alloc(len, tag) to get heap memory.
3. Use make_root(&x) to make the variable x which holds a pointer, as a root.
4. Use make_static_root(&x) to make the variable x which holds a pointer, as a static root,
   which will NOT be removed from the GC scanning even after frame ends.
5. Use toycaml_return(x) to return 'x' variable while returning from a function, so that the runtime can handle frame exit.
6. Use toycaml_frame when writing a new function's code just after the signature, 
   indicating that a new frame is formed to the runtime system.
7. Use long2val(x) and val2long(x) appropriately in your code, the runtime system considers longs(integers) in the OCaml format(value).
8. Use Field(ptr, offset) to access a slot in the heap memory allocated at ptr.
9. Testing: gcc testing_toycaml_c.c runtime.c -o test_output.out
